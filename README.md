## CS-Challenge-Data-Files

See this [Python Stub](Python-Stub.py) for instructions on accessing the data files online. Note that when linking to the data files you must use the "raw" link, not the web page link: 

!["Raw Link Image"](images/raw-link.png)

You can also view the stub [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pbeens/CS-Challenge-Data-Files/blob/master/Python-Stub.ipynb) as a Jupyter Notebook

*(Would anyone else like to contribute instructions for other languages?)*
